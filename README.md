# NestJS Template with MongoDB

This repository serves as a comprehensive template for building scalable applications using NestJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It is designed to kickstart your project by providing a solid foundation with essential configurations and integrations. This template includes several useful interceptors and filters to handle common tasks such as response transformation and error handling efficiently.

## Features

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.
- **Interceptors**: Enhance the capabilities of your routes by manipulating the data returned from your route handlers before it reaches the client.
- **Filters**: Centralized exception handling mechanism to catch exceptions thrown from anywhere in your application.

## Getting Started

To use this template for your project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

```

2. **Configure Env Variables**

```bash
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
```

## Running the Application

After completing the setup steps, you can start the application by running:

npm run start
```

For development, you might prefer running the application in watch mode:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Using the template
This template is designed to provide a starting point for your NestJS projects. It includes basic configurations for MongoDB connection using Mongoose, authentication mechanisms, and useful interceptors and filters for common tasks.

As you develop your application, you may need to customize and extend the template to suit your specific requirements.
